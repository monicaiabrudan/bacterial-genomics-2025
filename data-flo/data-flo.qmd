## A short introduction

**Data-flo ([https://data-flo.io/](/introduction/readme#what-is-data-flo)) is a system for customised integration and manipulation of diverse data via a simple drag and drop interface.**

For Data-flo documentation, go to <https://docs.data-flo.io/introduction/readme>

Data-flo can easily combine epidemiological data, genomic data, laboratory data, and various metadata from disparate sources (i.e., different data systems) and formats.

Data-flo provides a visual method to design a reusable pipeline to integrate, clean, and manipulate data in a multitude of ways, eliminating the need for continuous manual intervention (e.g., coding, formatting, spreadsheet formulas, manual copy-pasting).

Data-flo pipelines are combinations of ready-to-use data adaptors that can be tailored, modularised and shared for reuse and reproducibility. Once a Data-flo pipeline has been created, it can be run anytime, by anyone with access, to enable push-button data extraction and transformation. This saves significant time by removing the bulk of the manual repetitive workflows that require multiple sequential or tedious steps, enabling practitioners to focus on analysis and interpretation.

"Steps" in Data-flo are called ADAPTORS. There are three main types of adaptors, which serve different functions.

-   Importing data

-   Manipulating & transforming data

-   Exporting data

![Data-flo editing view. This is an example of a Data-flo that imports data from Google spreadsheets, through "Google spreadsheet" adaptors.](tutorial/google_input.jpg){width="100%"}

![Data-flo editing view. This is an example of a Data-flo where two datatables are merged using a "Join datatables" adaptor.](tutorial/merging_tables.jpg){width="100%"}

![Data-flo editing view. Using various adaptors, columns in a datatable can be removed or renamed, specific strings or blank values can be replaced, dates can be reformatted, distinct lists can be generated.](tutorial/edit_colums.jpg){width="100%"}

![Data-flo editing view. In this example, a Data-flo pushes updated data to a Microreact project and supplies the URL for that project using the "Update Microreact project" adaptor.](tutorial/output.jpg){width="100%"}
