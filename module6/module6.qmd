### ChatGPT for bioinformatics

This will work with a Pro subscription.

The purpose of this demo is to show how to merge CSV files produced by ARIBA Resfinder and Pathogenwatch, using ChatGPT.

The input files can be found here: <https://github.com/monicaiabrudan/bacterial-genomics/tree/main/module6/input>

And the output files can be found here: <https://github.com/monicaiabrudan/bacterial-genomics/tree/main/module6/output>

Upload the CSV files

Select only isolates that are present in all files, and are resistance to Ciprofloxacin.

The selection of Ciprofloxacin resistant isolates is based on the column "Ciprofloxacin" in the AMR profiles files.

**ChatGPT attempts to explain the genes that are responsible to Ciprofloxacin resistance, however, these are all wrong**
