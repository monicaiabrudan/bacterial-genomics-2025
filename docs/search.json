The strain being studied is then assigned a series of numbers as its allelic profile or multilocus sequence types.\nStrains with identical sequences for a given gene have the same allele for that gene, and two strains with identical sequences for all the genes have the same allelic profile.\nThe relationship between each allelic profile is expressed in a dendrogram of linkage distance that varies.\nCombination of variants = Sequence Type (ST)\nNumber of differences is ignored; a new identifier is given for every possible variant\nWith 30 alleles per locus: ~20 billion possibilities\nDatabase with observed combinations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing MLST to Study Bacterial Variation: Prospects in the Genomic Era, 2014, Future Microbiology\n\n\nMore general information on MLST can be found here\n\n\nMLST with ARIBA\nThe manual can be found here: https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/MLST-calling-with-ARIBA\nARIBA can be used for MLST using the typing schemes from PubMLST.

You should see the following files:\nLog\nRoadmaps\nSequences\nThe ’Log‘ file has a useful reminder of what commands you typed to get this assembly result, for reproducing results later on. ’Sequences‘ contains the sequences we put in, and ’Roadmaps‘ contains the index you just created.\nNow we will run the assembly with default parameters:\nvelvetg G18252308\n\nVelvet will end with a text like this:\nFinal graph has ... nodes and n50 of ..., max ..., total ..., using .../... reads\n\nThe number of nodes represents the number of nodes in the graph, which (more or less) is the number of contigs. Velvet reports its N50 (as well as everything else) in ‘kmer’ space. The conversion to ‘basespace’ is as simple as adding k-1 to the reported length.\nLook again at the folder asm_name, you should see the following extra files:\ncontigs.faGraphLastGraphPreGraphstats.txt\nThe important files are:\ncontigs.fa - the assembly itselfGraph - a textual representation of the contig graphstats.txt - a file containing statistics on each contig\nQuestions\n\nWhat k-mer did you use?\nWhat is the N50 of the assembly?\nWhat is the size of the largest contig?\nHow many contigs are there in the contigs.fa file?

Using a standard desktop PC, it can analyse datasets with thousands of samples, something which is computationally infeasible with existing methods, without compromising the quality of the results. 128 samples can be analysed in under 1 hour using 1 GB of RAM and a single processor. To perform this analysis using existing methods would take weeks and hundreds of GB of RAM. Roary is not intended for meta-genomics or for comparing extremely diverse sets of genomes.\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) sangerpathogens/roary roary -f /home/ubuntu/Data/roary /home/ubuntu/Data/annotations/*/*.gff\nThe summary output is present in the summary_statistics.txt\nCore genes (99% &lt;= strains &lt;= 100%) 1861\nSoft core genes (95% &lt;= strains &lt; 99%) 0\nShell genes (15% &lt;= strains &lt; 95%) 962\nCloud genes (0% &lt;= strains &lt; 15%) 838\nTotal genes (0% &lt;= strains &lt;= 100%) 3661\nAdditionally, Roary produces a gene_presence_absence.csv file that can be opened in any spreadsheet software to manually explore the results. In this file, you will find information such as gene name and gene annotation, and, of course, whether a gene is present in a genome or not.\nDrop the accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick and gene_presence_absence.csv files in Phandango\n\nWhen you analyze your own data, you will need a phylogeny that represents the evolutionary history of your isolates. The inference of a phylogenetic tree is not part of roary’s functions, but you can use the core gene alignment (file: core_gene_alignment.aln) as input to infer a tree.\nRoary comes with a python script that allows you to generate a few plots to graphically assess your analysis output. You will need the gene_presence_absence.csv file and the phylogeny at /home/ubuntu/Data/trees/tree.nwk.\nYou should get three files: a pangenome matrix, a frequency plot, and a pie chart.\npython /home/ubuntu/Software/roary_plots.py /home/ubuntu/Data/trees/tree_for_phandango.nwk /home/ubuntu/roary/gene_presence_absence.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of this exercise is broadly based on a tutorial by Martin Hunt.\n\n\n\nARIBA is a tool that identifies antibiotic resistance genes.

Run ARIBA on a reference database\n2. View summarized results using Phandango\n\nYou can run the commands in this module in the Amazon EC2 instance you were provided by your course instructor.\nARIBA should be already installed on this machine. If you need to use a different machine, please follow the instructions from Module 1 of this course.\n1. Run ARIBA on a reference database\nConfigure the Resfinder and CARD reference databases.\nariba getref resfinder out.resfinder\nariba prepareref -f out.resfinder.fa -m out.resfinder.tsv out.resfinder.prepareref\nariba getref card out.card\nariba prepareref -f out.card.fa -m out.card.tsv out.card.prepareref\nHow to run on one sample\nARIBA needs the database directories, for eg, out.resfinder.prepareref or out.card.prepareref, and two sequencing reads files reads.1.fastq.gz and reads.2.fastq.gz. The command to run ARIBA is:\nariba run out.resfinder.prepareref reads.1.fastq.gz reads.2.fastq.gz outdir\nThe above command will make a new directory called outdir that contains the results.\nRun ARIBA on all samples\nThe S. aureus dataset consists of many samples, and we need to run ARIBA on each sample, which can be done with a “for” loop. We assume that the reads files are named like this:\nname1_1.fastq.gz name1_2.fastq.gz\nname2_1.fastq.gz name2_2.fastq.gz\nname3_1.fastq.gz name3_2.fastq.gz\nThen we can run ARIBA on all samples like this (you may need to edit this command depending on how your own files are named):\nEg:\nfor sample in `ls *.1.fastq.gz | sed 's/\\.1.fastq.gz//'`\ndo\n  ariba run out.resfinder.prepareref $sample_1.fastq.gz $sample_2.fastq.gz $sample.ariba\ndone\nThe output directory of each sample is called $sample.ariba, for example name1.ariba is the output directory for sample name1.\nEXERCISE: Using the information above, write a script to fit the file names and paths in your own context and run ARIBA on all samples.\nARIBA output\nThe format of the output files are described here.\nViewing ARIBA results in Phandango\nThis section describes how to use Phandango to view a summary of ARIBA results from many samples.\nThe most important output file from ARIBA is the report called report.tsv. For this tutorial, we have all sample reports in the directory /home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output\nls /home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output | wc -l\nARIBA has a functon called “summary” that can summarise presence/absence of sequences and/or SNPs across samples. It takes at least two ariba reports as input, and makes a CSV file that can be opened in your favourite spreadsheet program, and also makes input files for Phandango. The two Phandango files (a tree and a CSV file) can be dropped straight into the Phandango page for viewing.\nThe tree that ARIBA makes is based on the CSV file, which contains results of presence/absence of sequence and SNPs, and other information such as percent identity between contigs and reference sequences. This means that it does not necessarily represent the real phylogeny of the samples. It is more accurate to provide a tree built from the sequencing data. For this reason, we will use a pre-computed tree file /home/ubuntu/Data/tree_for_phandango.tre.\nBasic usage of ariba summary\nCheck the options of ariba summaryusing the following command:\nariba summary -h\nFirst, let’s run ariba summary using the default settings, except we will skip making the tree:\nariba summary --no_tree out /home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output/*.tsv\nWe can see that this made two files:\nls out.*\nThey are the same except for the first line, which has Phandango-specific information. ARIBA uses the filenames as sample names in the output:\nhead -n 2 out.phandango.csv\nThe first name is “/home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output/*/sample.tsv”, and the rest are named similarly.\nThis is not ideal, as it will look ugly in Phandango. Further, the names must exactly match the names in the tree file for Phandango to work (have a look in the tree /home/ubuntu/Data/trees/tree_for_phandango.nwk). You could do a little hacking here using the Unix command sed on the CSV file. Instead, we can supply ARIBA with a file of filenames that also tells ariba what to call the samples in its output CSV files. Instead of “/home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output/sample.tsv”, we would like to simply use “sample”, which is cleaner and matches the tree file. It also means we can (and will) repeatedly run ariba summary with different options, and get output files that can be loaded straight into Phandango. This is one way to make the file with the naming information:\nls /home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output/*/report.tsv | awk -F/ '{name=$(NF-1); sub(/\\.ariba$/, \"\", name); print $0, name}' &gt; ARIBA_output/filenames.fofn\nThe file is quite simple. Column 1 is the filename, and column 2 is the name we would like to use in the output.\n head ARIBA_output/filenames.fofn\nNow we can rerun summary using this input file. Note the use of the new option –fofn.\nariba summary --no_tree --fofn ARIBA_output/filenames.fofn ARIBA_output/out /home/ubuntu/Data/ARIBA_output/*/report.tsv\nCheck that the renaming worked:\nhead -n 2 out.phandango.csv\nNow go to Phandango and drag and drop the files out.phandango.csv and trees/tree_for_phandango.nwk into the window. The result should like this\n\nThis a very high-level summary of the data. For each cluster, it is simply saying whether or not each sample has a ‘match’. Green means a match, and pink means not a match. For presence/absence genes, this means that the gene must simply be there to count as a match. If it is a “variant only” gene, then the gene must be there and one of the variants that we told ARIBA about earlier when generating the ARIBA database.\nMore information per cluster\nIn addition to a simple “yes” or “no” as to whether a sample “matches” a given cluster (as explained above), more columns can be output for each cluster. See the ARIBA summary wiki page for a full description of the options.\nVariants In the previous screenshot, where the option –preset cluster_all, there are two variant columns: “known_var” and “novel_var”. Green means “yes” and pink means “no”.\nPart 2: Antimicrobial Resistance Identification using Pathogenwatch\nBrowse the public collection:\nhttps://pathogen.watch/collection/mxebr8oz0wjm-module2-s-aureus\nDownload the AMR genes and AMR SNPs.\nPart 3: Compare results obtained with ARIBA Resfinder versus Pathogenwatch\nOpen the ARIBA summary files and compare them with the AMR genes and AMR SNPs files you downloaded from Pathogenwatch.\n\nWhich tool produced more results? Why?\nWhich tool would you use to report AMR in your collection of S. aureus?\n\nA Python script that compares the ARIBA Resfinder summary result with the Pathogenwatch AMR genes result is available on Github: https://github.com/monicaiabrudan/bacterial-genomics/blob/main/Compare_AMR_files.ipynb\nThe input files can be found here: https://github.com/monicaiabrudan/bacterial-genomics/tree/main/Compare_AMR_files"

    "text": "Read about Roary here.\nRoary is a high speed stand alone pan genome pipeline, which takes annotated assemblies in GFF3 format (produced by Prokka (Seemann, 2014)) and calculates the pan genome. Using a standard desktop PC, it can analyse datasets with thousands of samples, something which is computationally infeasible with existing methods, without compromising the quality of the results. 128 samples can be analysed in under 1 hour using 1 GB of RAM and a single processor. To perform this analysis using existing methods would take weeks and hundreds of GB of RAM. Roary is not intended for meta-genomics or for comparing extremely diverse sets of genomes.\ndocker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) sangerpathogens/roary roary -f /home/ubuntu/Data/roary /home/ubuntu/Data/annotations/*/*.gff\nThe summary output is present in the summary_statistics.txt\nCore genes (99% &lt;= strains &lt;= 100%) 1861\nSoft core genes (95% &lt;= strains &lt; 99%) 0\nShell genes (15% &lt;= strains &lt; 95%) 962\nCloud genes (0% &lt;= strains &lt; 15%) 838\nTotal genes (0% &lt;= strains &lt;= 100%) 3661\nAdditionally, Roary produces a gene_presence_absence.csv file that can be opened in any spreadsheet software to manually explore the results. In this file, you will find information such as gene name and gene annotation, and, of course, whether a gene is present in a genome or not.\nDrop the accessory_binary_genes.fa.newick and gene_presence_absence.csv files in Phandango\n\nWhen you analyze your own data, you will need a phylogeny that represents the evolutionary history of your isolates. The inference of a phylogenetic tree is not part of roary’s functions, but you can use the core gene alignment (file: core_gene_alignment.aln) as input to infer a tree.\nRoary comes with a python script that allows you to generate a few plots to graphically assess your analysis output. You will need the gene_presence_absence.csv file and the phylogeny at /home/ubuntu/Data/trees/tree.nwk.\nYou should get three files: a pangenome matrix, a frequency plot, and a pie chart.\npython /home/ubuntu/Software/roary_plots.py /home/ubuntu/Data/trees/tree_for_phandango.nwk /home/ubuntu/roary/gene_presence_absence.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first part of this exercise is broadly based on a tutorial by Martin Hunt.\n\n\n\nARIBA is a tool that identifies antibiotic resistance genes.

    "text": "SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Romania\nGenomic surveillance of pathogens aims to understand the emergence and dissemination of pathogens or their lineages of risk with the ultimate goal of implementing evidence-based interventions to protect public health. Epidemiological data from patients is collected by healthcare professionals. Data on species identification and any phenotypic or molecular characterization of the isolates is often generated by the microbiology laboratories linked to healthcare facilities and/or the reference laboratory. In an ideal scenario, the different sources of laboratory data are stored in a centralised surveillance system and database (such as WHONET). However, these systems rarely also incorporate genomic data produced by bioinformaticians.\nThe Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance develops free web applications for integration and visualisation of surveillance (and other) data, called data-flo and Microreact. The aim of this module is to highlight the role of the various analytics and sources of data in pathogen surveillance, and how streamlined data integration is essential for real-time decision making, while also introducing resources that can facilitate the inclusion of this topic in teaching curricula."

There are a few public workflows with useful transformations such as left join two CSVs (https://data-flo.io/run?bzYR3DtxRJsBty5ezb5LoJ) or the Geocoder (https://data-flo.io/run?kvpsi3T8V) that you can try.\n\nA similar workflow to the one used on this course can be found in the documentation https://docs.data-flo.io/tutorials/prep-outbreak-data-for-microreact. In this workflow, one of the inputs is a SNP matrix. \nData-flo also allows you to import data from a Google Spreadsheet (https://docs.data-flo.io/using-data-flo/specific-adaptors/google-spreadsheet) or from a database (https://docs.data-flo.io/tutorials/common-use-cases-solved/connect-directly-to-a-database) (as opposed to downloading data from the spreadsheet/database into a file). \n\nMicroreact documentation: https://docs.microreact.org/\nTo be able to edit and manage projects, please create your own Microreact Account https://microreact.org/api/auth/signin. \nYou can customise the colours of your visualisations by assigning colours to the different variables before you create the Microreact project and/or after the project was created https://docs.microreact.org/instructions/labels-colours-and-shapes.\nEveryone with access to a Microreact project has access to the data the project uses. Privacy and permissions can be configured to change who can access the project and its data https://docs.microreact.org/instructions/access-control-and-project-sharing."

    "text": "Reads QC\nIn this part of the exercise, we will use a programme called FastQC.\nFastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence Data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your Data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.\nThe main functions of FastQC are\n\nImport of Data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)\nProviding a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems\nSummary graphs and tables to quickly assess your Data\nExport of results to an HTML based permanent report\n\n\nRun FastQC programatically\nTo run non-interactively you simply have to specify a list of files to process on the command line. \nEg:\nfastqc somefile.txt someotherfile.txt\nfastqc /home/ubuntu/Data/*/*/*\n\n\nQC your fastq reads through the visual interface\nNavigate to /home/ubuntu/Software/FastQC and double click on the FastQC icon.\nIn the visual interface, open all files produced by FastQC and assess the results, eg ERR4635696_1_fastqc.html\nVisualize and interpret the FastQC results. Compare the QC results for Nanopore and Illumina sequence reads\nOptional: Unzip the files /home/ubuntu/Data/*/*/*_*_fastqc.zip and produce a script that extracts the information on reads lengths, GC contents etc; plot the results from all samples.\n\n\n\nFastQC Illumina reads\n\n\n\n\n\nFastQC Nanopore reads\n\n\n\n\nGenerate MultiQC report (aggregates all FastQC results)\nMultiQC looks for the .zip files produced by FastQC (not the .html files)\ncd /home/ubuntu/Data/QC\nmultiqc ERR4784794\nOpen in browser:\nNavigate to /home/ubuntu/Data/QC and double-click multiqc_report.html\nKey metrics to check:\nPer base sequence quality (should be &gt;28 for most bases)\nPer sequence quality scores (peak should be &gt;30)\nAdapter content (should be minimal)\nGC content (should match expected ~33% for S. aureus)\n\n\nRead Trimming/Filtering\n\n\nUsing fastp (fast and comprehensive)\nEg:\nfastp -i ERR4635696_1.fastq.gz -I ERR4635696_2.fastq.gz -o ERR4635696_1.clean.fastq.gz -O ERR4635696_2.clean.fastq.gz --qualified_quality_phred 20 --length_required 50 --detect_adapter_for_pe --html sample1_fastp.html --json sample1_fastp.json --thread 4\n\n\nRe-run MultiQC to confirm improvement\ncd /home/ubuntu/Data/QC\nmultiqc ERR4635696\nmultiqc ERR4635696_clean\nDecision point: If &gt;80% reads pass filtering and mean quality &gt;Q30, proceed to assembly."

Click on the “Pen” symbol on the top right menu. Click on the “Create New Chart”\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Present WGS QC statistics in a chart. Step 2: Drag the new chart to overlap with the tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Present WGS QC statistics in a chart. Step 3: An empty panel for the new chart will be shown on top of the tree panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Present WGS QC statistics in a chart. Step 4: In the Chart Type dropdown list select “Bar Chart”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask2: Present WGS QC statistics in a chart. Step 5: A new window appears. In the X Axis Column, select “WGS_QC_no_contigs” and for “Maximum number of bins” select 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Present WGS QC statistics in a chart. Step 6: The bar chart will look like above. Observe that most genomes have less the 100 contigs.\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating sequence types (STs) in Colombia?\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating STs in Colombia? Now that you’ve created one chart, you can create another one! Step 1: Go to the “Pen: symbol on the right hand side and click on the”Create New Chart”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating STs in Colombia? Step 2: The new chart can stay right on top of the previously created one.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating STs in Colombia? Step 3: Notice a white canvas on top of the previously generated chart.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating STs in Colombia? Step 4: Once again, from the Chart Type dropdown menu, select “Bar Chart”, and when the new view shows up on the “X Axis Column”, select ST.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominating STs in Colombia? Step 5: A new chart will appear. The labels on the x-axis appear squished and they are hard to read. Drag the panel divider on the left hand side of the chart, to increase the width of the panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominant STs in Colombia? Step 6: The information on the x-axis should be readable now. The 3 most abundant STs are ST11, ST258 and ST512.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominant STs in Colombia? Step 7: Click the “Views” panel on the left hand side, hover over “Kpn Colombia”, click on the three dots on the corner of the view and hit “Update View”\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: What are the dominant STs in Colombia? Step 8: Go to the Save icon on the right corner, press the icon and choose “Update This Project”\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Plot metadata blocks for the carbapenamase genes CTX-M-15, NDM-1, KPC and OXA. What are the prevalent AMR mechanisms detected ?\n\n\n\nTask 4: Plot metadata blocks for CTX-M-15, NDM-1, KPC and OXA genes. What are the prevalent AMR mechanisms detected ? Step 1: Press the icon on the top right of the tree panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Plot metadata blocks for CTX-M-15, NDM-1, KPC and OXA genes. What are the prevalent AMR mechanisms detected ? Step 2: In the Metadata blocks dropdown list, tick all boxes containing KPC, NDM, VIM, OXA and CTX-M-15 genes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4: Plot metadata blocks for CTX-M-15, NDM-1, KPC and OXA genes. What are the prevalent AMR mechanisms detected ? Step 3: The tree panel will show metadata columns. Yellow indicates presence of a certain gene and green indicates absence. In the panel shown here, it appears that the most common genes present are KPC-2, KPC-3, NDM-1 and CTX-M-15.\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes?\n\n\n\nTask 5: Which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes? Step 1: Go to the “Metadata blocks” and check the ST box.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes? Step 2: Observe the new metadata column next to the tree, with the header “ST”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes? In the tree with added metadata blocks, we can observe a large brown block of isolates belonging to ST258. You will need to check the Legend on the very right of Microreact.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 5: Which STs are associated with the presence of carbapenamase genes? On a close look, we can observe that ST258 is associated with the presence of the carbapenamase gene KPC-3.\n\n\nMicroreact demo link\nData taken from a series of articles published in 2021 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases:\n\nGlobal collection article\n\nPhilippines article\nIndia article\nNigeria article\nColombia article"
