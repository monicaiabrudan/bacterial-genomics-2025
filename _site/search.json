    "text": "Topics to be addressed during the workshop\n\n\n\nTraining Objectives\nThe workshop objectives are to 1) Refresh relevant domain specific knowledge and knowledge of tools frequently used in Digital Epidemiology, 2) Discuss real-case scenarios where digital epidemiology generated actionable data for public health, 3) Generate a stakeholders map for digital epidemiologists within each unit, 4) Identify the systems and data architectures 5) Identify strengths, challenges and priorities in Digital Epidemiology within each unit and 6) Start a support network for developing strength in Digital Epidemiology across all units.\nLearning objectives. By the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to 1) Identify relevant internal and external stakeholders, relevant to their work environment 2) Identify areas of weakness and strength in local Digital Epidemiology skills 3) Explain how digital epidemiology can be applied in own country-context 4) Discuss other real-world scenarios of applied digital epidemiology.\n\n\nTargeted competencies and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes\n\nDigital Epidemiology data tools and workflows\nFlow of data from sample to decision-making\nIntegration of epidemiological, laboratory and genomic data\nInterpretation of phylogenetic trees in the context of genomic epidemiology.\nIntegrated skills: Communication, Networking, Reporting\n\n\n\nTraining Methods and Instructional Strategies\n\nDiscussions, hands-on activities, case studies, group work\n\n\n\nDuration of training\n\nTwo days (14h total)\n\n\n\nSchedule of sessions\n\n\n\nWorkshop workflow\n\n\n\n\nAssessment and Evaluation\nPre-workshop and post-workshop assessments will be filled in by participants to measure Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes related to targeted competencies.\nThe effectiveness of the workshop will be evaluated through feedback questionnaires, handed in at the end of the last module. Follow-up questionnaires will be six months after the end of the workshop. Key success indicators of the workshop will consist of 1) the number of participants that are able to apply digital epidemiology skills in their local laboratories and 2) the number of participants that can facilitate training of new digital epidemiologists in local contexts.\n\n\nResources\nA series of resources will be made available for participants prior, during and after the workshop: use cases / tutorials / documentation and printed training materials.\n\n\nRecommended background knowledge\n\nBiological and clinical mechanisms underlying infectious pathogens\nInfectious disease epidemiology and surveillance\nDisease outbreaks\nPathogens of clinical significance\nAnti-microbial resistance"

This immediately prompted the closure of the 2 water sources.\n\nDoes this confirm that the source of the outbreak was contaminated water from Ñu Guasú park?\n\nOne colony from each source was sequenced on Illumina MiSeq by the reference lab. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (tree.nwk) was inferred from the genomes of the 34 clinical samples and 2 environmental (water) samples. Six genomes from a previous outbreak (Jan-Feb 2020) were also included in the tree inference and their associated data added to the (epi_data.csv) file.\nThe disease detectives now have the information needed for the investigation in the following formats:\n\nepi_data.csv Epi data from 34 clinical cases and 6 cases from previous outbreak\nEpicollect project Metadata of 13 water sources from Ñu Guasú Park\nlab_results.xlsx Culture and serotyping results\ntree.nwk Phylogenetic tree of 34 clinical cases, 2 culture-positive water samples, and 6 cases from previous outbreak\n\nThe files are located in this google drive link.\nWe will combine data from these different sources with a data-flo workflow that takes the files above and the data from the Epicollect project as input, and creates as an output a Microreact project where the data can be visualised.\nOpen the data-flo workflow (https://data-flo.io/run?prnvpvmKzq8rDKbPD9ZXAs)\n\n\nCopy the workflow to your own dataflo account.\n\n\nThis will open a copy of this workflow in your dataflo account.\n\n\nOn a different browser tab, get your microreact API access token at https://microreact.org/my-account/settings (you must already have created your microreact account).\n\n\nEdit the workflow to include your own microreact API access token.\n\nClick on *access token in the Create microreact project box\nFrom the options on the right, select Bind to value\nPaste your API access token in the VALUE box\n\n\n\nSave your newly edited dataflo project by clicking on the save icon.\n\n\nNow lets go to the implementation page by clicking on the i icon.\n\n\nTo run the workflow paste the url of the Epicollect5 project (https://five.epicollect.net/project/asuncion-2023-s-sonnei-outbreak) and upload the files, found here.\n\n\nClick on Run.

    "text": "The importance of Digital Epidemiology\n“Digital epidemiology is epidemiology building on digital data and tools” (Salathé M. et al, Life Sci Soc Policy. 2018)\n\nFunded by the NIHR under the Global Health Research Unit programme, our work at the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance focuses specifically on the applications of digital epidemiology of infectious diseases, including outbreak investigations, pathogen surveillance, understanding of vaccine efficacy and spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and vehicles. \nThe importance of digital epidemiology has been raised to a global level during the pandemic. The value of bringing together genomic with epidemiological and clinical data improved public health decision making, informing experts with regard to virus variants expansions and adding significant contributions to the investigation on the origin of the virus. \nMoreover, the pandemic has taught us that the effective use of digital epidemiology can impact on operational decisions in healthcare settings, impacting on patient wellbeing and outcomes.\nDuring the COVID pandemic there has been a learning curve for many laboratories around the world, who were able to use genomic and digital data to good effect, changing operational approaches and decisions based on results. However, interdisciplinary teams formed of wet-lab scientists, Bioinformaticians, clinicians and non-technical staff (hospital managers, for example) often found barriers in communication of information. The relevance and impact of Digital Epidemiology was often difficult to explain between different professional specialisations. Scientists familiar with Digital Epidemiology often found it challenging to communicate to colleagues what genomic data could and could not reveal. \nThere is a general need to learn how to interpret information related to Digital Epidemiology and to better communicate results to various stakeholders."
